# Portfolio Project  
This project was completed as part of a professional Python course. 

It demonstrates my ability to work with real-world data using Python and Jupyter Notebook, including data cleaning, 
analysis, and visualization. The notebook is designed to showcase the skills Iâ€™ve developed throughout the course.
